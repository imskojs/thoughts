# Angular thoughts/notes/gotchas

* Components in `entryComponents` array are not tree shaked (this means non-entry components are tree shaked even if it is defined in the `declarations` array if not used). Components defined in Router, or defined in `bootstrap` array have the same effect as defining them in `entryComponents` array.  
* For services use;
   ```ts
   @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
   // or
   @Injectable({providedIn: SomeModule})
   ```
   As it will be tree shaked if unused.  Does this mean services defined in `providers` array are not tree shaked even if unused?  
* Lazy Loaded Module: 
    * Providers are scoped to a module where service is defined. i.e multiple injectors.
    * The router adds all of the providers from the root injector to the child injector. Hence root injector can be used with lazy loaded modules, but it follows the same `__proto__` pattern of JS, where it looks for local injector if it is there it will use that if not it will use the parent injector and so on. 
* Eagerly Loaded Module (default behaviour):
    * providers have global scope, i.e. one injector  
    * Component `providers` is an independent provider, only a component and its tree can see it. Each instance of the component has a new instance of the provider.  
* In both lazy loaded module and eagerly loaded module, if some module is imported in both the root module and feature module,  there could be a problem. If importee module contains `declarations` and no `providers` then it's all good but if `providers` is defined in an importee module then following unintentionality would happen;  
      * If service of importee module is used in root module, then;  
            * Lazy loaded module would create seperate injector and instantiate new local scoped importee service  
            * Eagerly loaded module would try to overwrite the already imported service possibly causing error.  
      * If service of importee module is not used in root module, then;  
            * Same behaviour as above, i.e. Lazy loaded module would create seperate injector and instantiate new local scoped importee service  
            * Eagerly loaded module would create a service that is injectable at root level. No error but probably not intented behaviour  
Whatever the case, importing a module that has a provider defined in it would most likely cause a problem. That's why when making a module that defines `providers` we should have a way to decide whether to include `providers` defined in the module or not.  
* The same module can be configured with `forRoot()` (by convention, it can be any static function) to make it suitable for loading it in root module. `forRoot` is a static method in the module definition that returns extra providers that should be included it were to be imported within the root module.
